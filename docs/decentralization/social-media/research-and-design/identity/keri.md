**KERI:**

**KERI: Key Event Registry Infrastructure**

_&quot;KERI is the first truly decentralized identity system. It is ledger-less, so it doesn&#39;t need to use a ledger or is ledger-portable. Its identifiers are not locked to any given ledger and may switch as needed. In other words, KERI identifiers are genuinely portable._

_KERI is inherently supportive of GDPR (global data protection rights) compliance. KERI provides non-intertwined identifier trust bases, meaning that a given identifier&#39;s data may be erased and truly forgotten._

_KERI has a decentralized, secure root-of-trust based on cryptographic self-certifying identifiers. It has separable control over shared data which means each entity is truly self-sovereign over its identifiers. It uses hash-chained data structures called Key Event Logs that enable ambient cryptographic verifiability. In other words, any log may be verified anywhere at anytime by anybody.&quot;_

**KERI.DotNet**

I am particularly interested in the Rust implementation of KERI. It would be great if we could put a DotNet wrapper around that library. Thoughts?
