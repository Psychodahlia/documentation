**The GDPR**

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General\_Data\_Protection\_Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)

&quot;_The GDPR&#39;s primary aim is to enhance individuals&#39; control and rights over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business.&quot;_

These regulations are in harmony with our goals to give the user complete control over their data.

Of particular interest is the &quot;Right to be forgotten.&quot; This means that users have the right to delete themselves from a public database. I think this is crucial, and we need to think carefully about implementing it. Obviously, if a user or its data were written to a public blockchain, their public keys are permanently there. So how does one &quot;forget&quot; a thing that cannot be deleted. KERI has a solution to that. See KERI.
