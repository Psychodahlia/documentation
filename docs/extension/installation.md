Follow these instructions to manually install the extension. This allows you to test early releases and updates to the extension. These early releases
can potentially have bugs, [issues](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore-extension/issues) (report by clicking link) and problems.

1. Download the extension package from [releases](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore-extension/releases).   
Download the `blockcore-*.zip` file to your local computer.

2. Unpack the .zip file to a folder anywhere on your computer.

3. Use a Chromium-based browser, like Brave, Edge, Chrome and others that supports extensions.

Either find the extension page through the menu, or open this URL:

[edge://extensions/](edge://extensions/)   
[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)   
[brave://extensions/](brave://extensions/)   

From the extension page in your browser, find the "Developer mode" toggle and turn it on.
