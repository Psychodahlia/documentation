Blockcore: Documentation
-----------------------

Collection of documents used as architecture and technical reference for implementation of BlockCore technologies.

These documents are free (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)) and anyone can contribute, please feel free to do a PR with suggestions, additions, fixes, etc.

Don't expect all ideas and features written in these documents to be implemented. They are guidance documents, they should
document what already exists, what is being worked on, what is planned and ideas for the future.

If you discover a bug or other problem with BlockCore or supporting technologies, please report it. The are two different processes, 
[responsible disclosure](SECURITY-ISSUES.md) for security bugs and public issue tracking ([Blockcore](https://github.com/block-core/blockcore/issues)) for all other bugs.
